      <p>
         The development of cTAKES started in 2006 by a team of physicians, computer scientists and software engineers
         at the Mayo Clinic. The development team was led by Dr. Guergana Savova & Dr. Christopher Chute. cTAKES is
         released open source under an Apache v2.0 license. This system was deployed at Mayo and is currently an
         integral part of their clinical data management infrastructure and has processed in excess of 80 million
         clinical notes.

         Following Dr. Savova's move to Children's Hospital Boston in early 2010, the core development team expanded to
         include Mayo Clinic and Children's Hospital Boston. Additional collaborations with external groups at
         University of Colorado, Brandeis University, University of Pittsburgh, University of California at San Diego
         continue to extend the capabilities of cTAKES into areas such Temporal Reasoning, Clinical Question and
         Answering, and coreference resolution for the clinical domain. In 2010, cTAKES was adopted by the I2B2 program
         and is a central component of the SHARP Area 4.

         On June 11, 2012, cTAKES entered the Apache Incubator. On March 20, 2013, cTAKES graduated into an Apache TLP.
